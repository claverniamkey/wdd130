    <p>Hello everyone! I am from the Ivory Coast currently living there. I am
    27 years old. I have six siblings and I am the last but one. I am still single .</p>
    <p>I was baptized since I was 11 years old. I served a full-time mission in 
     the Ghana Accra Mission, I have really enjoyed those times of heartfelt
     sevice. My favourite scripture is Mosiah3:19.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as a distribution electrician and I do love that
    job and actually want to end my professional career as a power engineer 
    someday. I love informatics too, and because electrical engineering is not
    available online I am then taking a course related to informatics for the 
    time being.</p>
    <p>I am very happy to be part of this group and looking forward to get to
    know each one of you. Here is my web page! </p>
